    Code                & Cause \\ \hline
    \texttt{nr}         & No-response. The participant had no more than a 2-log reduction in viral load. \\
    \texttt{bkt}        & Breakthrough. The participant had an on-treatment relapse. \\
    \texttt{rl}         & Relapse. The participant relapsed after treatment ended. \\
    \texttt{svr12}      & Sustained viral response. The participant had no detectable viral load at 12 weeks. \\
    \texttt{svr24}      & Sustained viral response. The participant had no detectable viral load at 24 weeks. \\
