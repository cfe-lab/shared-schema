    Code                & Meaning \\ \hline
    \texttt{nr}         & No-response. The participant had no more than a 2-log reduction in viral load. \\
    \texttt{bkt}        & Breakthrough. The participant had an on-treatment viral rebound after having undetectable HCV RNA. \\
    \texttt{rl}         & Relapse. The participant had a viral rebound after having undetectable RNA after treatment. \\
    \texttt{svr12}      & Sustained viral response. The participant had no detectable viral load at 12 weeks following treatment. \\
    \texttt{svr24}      & Sustained viral response. The participant had no detectable viral load at 24 weeks following treatment. \\
