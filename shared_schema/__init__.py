'''The definition of the database schema for the SHARED project

This module contains entity and field information for all of the thins
that live in the database, as well as derived information for
documentation and submission schemes.

The test suite covers basic checks on the schema (e.g. no duplicate
fields, foreign keys are sensible) as well as the more visible
functions of the module.
